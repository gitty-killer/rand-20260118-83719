# Design Notes

Objective
- Prioritize translations by impact and urgency.

Data flow

- Validate each record against rules and categories
- Compute totals, averages, and top-ranked items
- Render a report with key metrics and issues

Validation rules
- word_count must be between min and max
- priority_score must be 0 to 100
- Category must be one of the configured categories
- Status must be one of the allowed statuses

Extension ideas
